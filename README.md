```bash
git clone https://github.com/fatmaT2001/Signal-Data-Analyzer.git
pip install scipy numpy matplotlib
```

## Features
- Load and analyze data from MATLAB `.mat` files, with various examples available in the samples folder.
- Plot signal samples with respect to time.
- Calculate ensemble mean and autocorrelation of signals.
- Determine time mean and power spectral density of signals.
- Calculate autocorrelation for specific samples and plot 3D autocorrelation functions.
- Evaluate time autocorrelation function (ACF) for different time lags and plot ACF for all time differences.
- Compute and visualize the power spectral density of signals.
- Calculate the total average power of the signal.
